Numpy Arrays is a package inside of python that allows you to access more functions such as using an array and manipulating it in different ways.
```{python}
import numpy as np
a=np.array(range(20))
a
a**1/2
```
Strings is a method used to separate and combine various lines of code. By using the + key, we could combine the beginning and end of the sentence. Using the ' ' allowed there to be a proper space between words. printing it with /n separated the two lines.
```{python}
Beginning = "The cat wanted"
End = "to drink milk"
Beginning + End
Beginning + ' ' + End
print("The cat wanted \n to drink milk")
```
